# NematodeRecognition
Model using MobileNet from Google to recognize and count the number of nematodes on a petri dish from either a photo or a live video feed. This project uses scripts from Nicholas Renotte to help install dependencies and verify installations.

## Milestones:
1. Completed prototype image capture using waterbottle, face, and catpin.
2. Completed inporting and setting up dependencies to lever pretrained model

## Current:
Stuck on training model due to incompatability with Python3.11
